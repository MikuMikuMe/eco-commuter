# eco-commuter

Creating a complete Python program for an intelligent carpooling platform like eco-commuter is a complex task that involves various components such as route optimization, user management, and real-time scheduling. Below is a simplified version of how such a system might be implemented. This example focuses on core concepts and provides a foundation you can expand upon.

```python
import itertools
import random
import heapq

class User:
    def __init__(self, user_id, location):
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.location = location  # Location should ideally be GPS coordinates or similar

class Carpool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = []
        self.capacity = 4  # For simplicity, assume each carpool has a capacity of 4

    def add_user(self, user):
        if len(self.users) < self.capacity:
            self.users.append(user)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Carpool is full. Maximum capacity is {self.capacity}.")

    def __repr__(self):
        user_ids = [user.user_id for user in self.users]
        return f"Carpool(users={user_ids})"

def calculate_distance(location1, location2):
    # Placeholder function for calculating the distance between two locations
    # Replace this with a proper distance calculation, e.g., using geopy or similar
    return random.randint(1, 10) 

def optimize_routes(users):
    # Simple route optimization by clustering closest users
    # This is a naive implementation, and in a real-world scenario,
    # advanced algorithms or libraries like OR-Tools would be preferable

    if not users:
        return []

    # Calculate pairwise distances
    distances = {(u1.user_id, u2.user_id): calculate_distance(u1.location, u2.location) for u1, u2 in itertools.combinations(users, 2)}

    # Min-heap to organize distances
    heap = [(dist, u1, u2) for (u1, u2), dist in distances.items()]
    heapq.heapify(heap)

    carpools = []
    used_users = set()

    while heap and len(used_users) < len(users):
        dist, u1, u2 = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if u1 not in used_users and u2 not in used_users:
            carpool = Carpool()
            try:
                # Attempt to add both users to the carpool
                carpool.add_user(next(user for user in users if user.user_id == u1))
                carpool.add_user(next(user for user in users if user.user_id == u2))
                used_users.update([u1, u2])
                carpools.append(carpool)
            except ValueError as e:
                print(f"Error adding user to carpool: {e}")

    # Add any remaining users who weren't added to a carpool yet
    for user in users:
        if user.user_id not in used_users:
            carpool = Carpool()
            try:
                carpool.add_user(user)
                carpools.append(carpool)
            except ValueError as e:
                print(f"Error adding user to carpool: {e}")

    return carpools

def main():
    # Create some example users with random locations
    users = [User(user_id=i, location=(random.uniform(-180, 180), random.uniform(-90, 90))) for i in range(10)]

    print("Initial Users:")
    for user in users:
        print(f"User ID: {user.user_id}, Location: {user.location}")

    carpools = optimize_routes(users)

    print("\nOptimized Carpools:")
    for carpool in carpools:
        print(carpool)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Key Points:
- **User Class**: Represents a user with an ID and location.
- **Carpool Class**: Manages a group of users in a single carpool, with a defined capacity.
- **Distance Calculation**: A placeholder method is used; you might want to implement advanced geographic distance calculations.
- **Route Optimization**: A naive implementation using pairwise distances and clustering. This can be optimized further with more advanced algorithms.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is included when adding users to a full carpool.

### Future Enhancements:
- Integrate real geographical data and use a library like `geopy` for accurate distance calculations.
- Use advanced optimization algorithms for better route and schedule optimization.
- Implement a proper database to store user information and route history.
- Add a user interface (UI) for users to interact with the carpooling system.
- Consider real-time traffic data for dynamic scheduling and routing.
